# Pages

This folder contains the pages of the SkyePortal client application.

## Overview

The `pages` folder is where you can find the different pages that make up the user interface of the SkyePortal client application. Each page represents a specific view or screen that the user can interact with.

## File Structure

- `PageName.js`: The main JavaScript file that defines the logic and behavior of the page.
- `PageName.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles specific to the page.
- `PageName.test.js`: The test file that contains unit tests for the page.

3. Implement the logic and styling for your page in the respective files.
